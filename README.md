# TEST THREE.JS WITH REACT

Little exercise using React instead of simple html file.

## Solar System

I drew the solar system as first exercise, not really at scale of course... It contains a star (the sun), 9 planets (I put back Pluton as a planet) and their respectives moons if exist.

## Run the system

If you want to try it yourself, first clone this repository. In the console, at good directory (react-threejs)

```
npm install // to install deps
npm run dev // to launch on localhost:3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
